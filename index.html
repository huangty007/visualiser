            <p>This is a tool for visualising the combinatorial maps by using different techniques. Firstly, it could
              make the concept more accessible and interesting, which is quite important for the beginners who are new
              to the relevant knowledge. As the mean time, for those researchers who conduct related research, this tool
              could help them improve their effciency and productivity effectively. </p>
            <p>If you want to learn more about the combinatorial maps, you can still explore this page. Otherwise, if
              you want to experience the tool as soon as possible, you can go and try the visuliser page. </p>

              <h3>Combinatorial maps</h3>
              <p>Combinatorial map is a topological structure which describe a graph embedded in a surface. It includes
                three components,<a href="#Vertices">vertices</a>, <a href="#Faces">faces</a> and <a
                  href="#Edges">edges</a>, which are represent by <a href="#Darts">darts (half-edges)</a>. There are
                very strict constrains of each component, so that only if two maps are isomorphic by a homeomorphism of
                the underlying surfaces, they could be conjugation equivalent. The picture shows three combintorial
                maps, the numbers written by hand in the picture are the number of darts. Although all of them have the
                same number of darts, vertices, edges and faces, the first two are equivalent and the last is not. It is
                obvious that each component of the structure is around by the darts. How to use darts to indicate each
                part? We have to know concept of <a href="#Perms">permutations</a>. Let's begin with it!</p>
              <img src="../image/equivalent.png">
              <h4 id="Perms">Permutations</h4>
              <p><a type="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">Permutation</a> is the act to arrange
                the members of an ordered set or sequence. It perform on the all section. For example, set {1,2} has two
                permutations (1,2) and (2,1)(written as tuple).</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Two-line notation</b></li>
                <p>The quite directly and clearly way to describe the permutaion is two-line notation, which has two
                  rows. The first row is the list of elements in set <i>S</i>, and the second line is its permutation.
                  Take {1,2,3} as example,
                  <img src="../image/two-line.png" style="width: 100px;height:50px;">is one of its permutations by this
                  notation.</p>
                <li><b>One-line notation</b></li>
                <p>Since the first row of the permutations is the "natural" order, the permutation can omit as one-line
                  notation. The permutation in one-line notation can be written as <img src="../image/one-line.png"
                    style="width: 150px;height:20px;">. For the two-line notation, the second line could be indicated as
                  <em>f(x)</em>, like <em>f(1)=2, f(2)=3 and f(3)=1</em> in the above example. The result of the
                  one-line
                  notation of the it is (2,3,1).</p>
                <li><b>Cycle notation</b></li>
                <p>The permutation can be decomposition into disjoint cycles. The formula is <img
                    src="../image/cycle.png" style="width: 200px;height:20px;">, which means applying the permutation to
                  the elements in set
                  repeatly. Take the example again, the cycle notation of it is (2,3,1). You might find the result of
                  last two notations for the example is the same, the reason is that this permutation is identity
                  permutation, on the other word, it is 1-cycles, which consists of only one cylce and denoted by single
                  1-cycle(x). I will use cycle notation to indicate each component in the follow parts.</p>
              </ul>
              <h4 id="Darts">Darts/Half-edges</h4>
              <p>Unlike the general graph, the edges of the combinatorial maps are divide into two parts, which called
                darts or half-edges (The difference between these titles is the way to show them, the arrow is used to
                indicate the two parts of edges is called darts,while the half-edges just segment the edges directly. I
                used the darts type in the examples below.) With the help of the property, all the component can be
                discribed by the sets of permutations of darts.</p>
              <img src="../image/darts.png">
              <h4 id="Edges">Edges</h4>
              <p>From the image in the darts section we can learn that, the edges can be describe by the two darts, so
                that the permutation of darts fot this component is a pair of darts like (0,1). In the visuliser, I use
                the array to store the data, so the result for this is printed as [[0,1],..]. </p>
              <h4 id="Vertices">Vertices</h4>
              <p>One vital feature of permutations is each of them have the ability to describe the specific order,
                which means the permutation (1,2,3) and (1,3,2) are totally different, that is also the reason why we
                use the permutations to represent the combinatorial maps. Therefore, we can indicate a vertex by darts
                with certain order. The permutaion of vetex is (0,1,2) by anti-clockwise.</p>
              <img src="../image/vertex.png">
              <h4 id="Faces">Faces</h4>
              <p>Last, we focus on the faces, this component has two parts, the internal and the external. The internal
                faces still keep the clockwise, while the external parts follow the anti-clockwise. The image (a) shows
                the darts around the general faces, there two faces the permutaion of the internal one is (0,4,2) and
                for external is (1,3,5). For loop like (b) also have two parts the (0) for internal and (1) for
                external.</p>
              <img src="../image/face.png">
              <p>Now, we know all components and how to represent by darts. Let see a more complicate example. Here is
                the classical combinatorial map, which can use formula <b>M = (D, σ, α)</b> to represent it. D indicate
                the
                finite set of darts [1,2,3,..], σ is the a set of permutations for vertices (note:[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],...])
                and α denote edges(note:[[1,14],[2,11],...]). Actually, the faces(note:[[1,11,13],[2,4,10],...]) are
                hidden in this formula, the ϕ is used to represent it, and it can be calculated through <b>ϕ = σ o
                  α</b>.</p>
              <img src="../image/map.png">

              <div class="form-group row">
                <h3 class="col-md-2">Visualiser</h3><a type="link" href="/html/type1.html"><span

              </div>
              <p>We know enough about the combinatorial maps now. Let me show you some interesting features of it. These
                features also support the ideas for producing visuliser.</p>
              <h4>Spanning Tree</h4>
              <p><a type="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree">Spanning Tree</a> is the general
                subgraph of conneted graph. It build a single tree path through all vertices, and it is obvious that
                there is not only one spanning tree of a map. Here we use the <b>DFS
                  algorithm</b> to find the spanning tree of the maps. After build the tree, I used the tree drawing
                algorithm introduced by <a type="link" href="http://dirk.jivas.de/papers/buchheim02improving.pdf"
                  style="color: #17202A"> C.
                  Buchheim, M. J Unger, and S. Leipert.</a> The first two methods are both based on this
                structure. The second method can be seen as the upgraded version of the previous one because the most
                spanning trees of the maps look like a straight line rather than a tree structure, which might look
                quite mass after finish the complete work. Therefore, adding the visual nodes to indicate the darts of
                the vertices, and shap the sketch of the structure closer to the tree.</p>
              <img src="../image/spanning tree.png">
              <h4>Dual maps</h4>
              <p> The embedded graph have the<a type="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph"> dual
                  graph</a> on the same surface. The vertices of dual maps are the center of faces in corresponding
                combintorial maps. The darts around vertices will be the darts around the faces in the original maps.
                Inspired by this structure, I found I could generate each faces of the map and then gluing them together
                by the edges, if it succeeds, it can even restore the complete surface which the maps embedded in.
              </p>
