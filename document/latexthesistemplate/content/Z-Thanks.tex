Thanks to my supervisor, Noam Zeilberger, under his guidance, my project went smoothly. He always provides me with sufficient background knowledge, gives me some key tips in ideas, and highlights key issues to help me improve my project. I also thank to my families and friends who support me to go throughout the year.
