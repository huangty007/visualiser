\chapter{Conclusion}
Summarily, the project is to find different methods to visualise the combinatorial maps which is a topological structure. According to the previous research and work, the project set out to explore the layout of the map through searching the properties of combinatorial map. Firstly, it has the spanning tree and the structure can be produced based on the tree model. As the same time, many tree drawing algorithm can be used to build the tree structure. After implementing the first method, we found that the additional information is needed for the tree structure. The improved version of tree based method aims to strengthen the tree structure and makes the whole layout more transparent. Other than the spanning tree, another feature called dual of maps provide a new idea about the visualisation. Drawing faces and then gluing them. Unfortunately, the gluing method did not be implemented. From the whole project, the tool has already achieved the goals, though it still have some issues need to be fixed.
